## Improving Retrieval in Theme-specific Applications using a Corpus Topical Taxonomy

This repository provides the source code of "Improving Retrieval in Theme-specific Applications using a Corpus Topical Taxonomy" accepted in TheWebConf (WWW2024) as a research paper.


### 1. Overview
We introduce a new plug-and-play ToTER framework which improves PLM-based retrieval using a corpus topical taxonomy.

### 2. How to use
Please refer to 'Guide to using ToTER.ipynb' file.

### 3. Resources
- Due to their large size, we provide necessary files (e.g., PLM-embeddings, trained classifier) through another file-sharing system: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BmUmlAV4i4-lwwQdBkuDsCZS8-OS-y8M/view?usp=sharing
